## Info about the data

### Scoring

Restaurants are given scores from 0-400 points based on number of violations and how risky those violations are.
> The violations are added up between red and blue violations. If the total red critical violations is 90 or more, or the total of red and blue is 120 or more, then the establishment will be closed.

#### Types of violations

Red violations carry the most risk for food borne illness and are often called "critical"; an example of a "red" violation would be food left in the "danger zone" between 41F and 135F for more than 4 hours. Blue violations can be thought of as a general cleanliness or facility maintenance issue. Dirty floors or shelving or torn refigerator door gaskets are possible "blue" violations.
